“We will have our day in the sun,” he had told Rachel and the others some months ago, after she confessed the melon had gone to rot. 
“A day of cantaloupe ripened to sunset, and we live in a city with true autumn, and Dimi’s filter paper burns with no ash.” 
The monotonous weather and latest lab woes were discussed like as not. 
“One day, we will have our day in the sun.”  

Tonight was not that day, Jasper reminisced. He walked into campus, shuddering over a brief flight of stairs, in the final minutes before midnight.
It was not so bad as he’d feared.
No lance of pain accompanied every step, symptoms owing primarily to uninspired novelists; rather, the walking became a drum major to the tired painful throbbing that had been with him all month. 
*The hour of the wolf*, Jasper thought, *though I come to it needing a printer.*  

Jasper saw no one as he walked. 
The summer heat and sodium lights left the walks warm and still at night, more so the emptiness of a parking lot than a cemetery, and he heard snatches of crickets in passing, bleating a worn, anxious chirp.
Nearing his office, he found himself listening for a carillon, though this school had none. 
Somewhere up north, one would be ringing, heralding the twelfth hour, but Jasper could no more hear it than taste the ocean fog. 
It would play music as well, at every six-hour interval save midnight. 
Feeling half a corpse, steeling himself, he entered the building and called the elevator.  

A few years ago, Jasper heard each of those songs, dawn, noon, and dusk, on more days than not.
Now, he stumbled through days like a drunkard down a spiral staircase, sleeping, working, surviving in fits and starts.
Before, he never would have been caught awake past midnight more than fortnightly, much less stepping into a languid office elevator.
Now, he merely set the blinds against the sun and made do.  

Part of Jasper’s mind fretted dimly over the awkward prospect of running into one of his officemates.
Two of them favored a later schedule, with work often stretching into the evening, and it was possible their schedules had drifted further in the few weeks he’d been out of the office.
*I might even find Minqi asleep on the couch.*
He didn’t, though. 
The office was dark and empty, though Kartik’s desk had a fresh stack of papers and two inches of water remained in the kettle.
Karl’s humidifier was finally making headway, though it seemed the air conditioning was still uncalibrated, and dialed low against the afternoon sun it left the room chilly at night.
Jasper fell into his chair and pulled out his laptop, sullenly reminding himself it was Saturday.
He opened a pdf of the order—one from last year since his doctor hadn’t sent a new one—and moved his dongle to the printer. 
He’d learned it was best to have the order on paper: Quest often failed to receive fax.  

The printer whirred, and Jasper let out a long breath.
*One step forward.*
It was today’s piece of what had to be done.
He drew in a calmness, defanging a bit of the pain, and set the kettle to boil before collecting the printed page.
*No caffeine...* Jasper thought, though already he was reaching past the hibiscus and dandelion root to a box of mountain tea.
*Blackberry leaves and thyme, from Armenia if they tell it true.*
Steam rolled out of his mug as he poured, smelling of tannins and old woodland powers.  

Jasper walked to the window and stood still, scented steam condensing on the glass.
Outside, the headlights of a campus security vehicle lit the manicured hedges and swept cobbles of the tree-lined walk below with suburban ennui, but in the darkness which followed the sight could have as easily been a shrouded streambed.
In his mind he hopped a gate and stood a long time watching it.  

When he drank, the tea had cooled enough for a good mouthful.
The hot, astringent liquid felt so unlike the dull ache of life as it ran down his throat, leaving behind a far-off huskiness. 
Two more swallows followed, gripping at the husk and pulling him along with it as cool air buffeted the foggy window. 
For the span of a few breaths, he felt as if some time ago he had unwittingly gotten himself turned inside out, and only now had some kind being taken it upon itself to reach within him and set things right.
When at last Jasper stepped away from the window, the office seemed incongruously bright, and he switched off the light before sinking into his chair. 
He found himself back in time, remembering black berry bushes and tanoaks and sucking in cool fog, feeling, for all the world, quite little, but whole and connected to a place, half a copse and half a twisted foothill trail, leading...  

Jasper woke before dawn, his body protesting.
Pained, he stood, and downed the last of the mountain tea, smiling at the taste of dormant life in the cold dregs. 
Checking his folder for the printed order, he slid it away and shouldered his pack. 
*That was good.* 
He would get the test tomorrow, and well, however unlikely an infection, it was worth it to rule out the differential diagnosis.
*What I came for, and some decent sleep besides.* 

Leaving the building, the elevator chimed for six floors as he descended, and some wordless, long forgotten song rang out softly in his mind. 
The walk back to his apartment ground the arrowheads of pain into a dull aching gravel, as the black sky in the east turned grey.
