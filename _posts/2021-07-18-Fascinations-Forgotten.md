Tonight I texted with an old friend who, hearing I was headed to grad school, asked me if I was still interested in volcanoes. 
Not the same old friend I had excitedly texted nearly four years ago, in a fit of college-major-reservation-induced soul searching, after learning that "volcanologist" was an extant career.
She told me she'd study bulldozers (or was it dump trucks?) if I dropped chem E for volcanoes, but reneged to CS for, she said, the money. 
I haven't spoken to her in a few years. 

I did, however, drop chemical engineering. 
Over a California winter of 4-year plans and introspection, I decided that most of what I liked in chem E was chemistry and feeling like I mattered, and most of what I liked in chemistry was thinking about why things were sticky, and the consequences of jiggling. 
Now I've rebranded them as quantum and stat mech, and graduated with a degree in physics. 
It became the clear choice by that April; I believed its strong mathematical and conceptual foundation, flexibility to explore other topics, and low likelyhood of precipitating death by fume hood would serve me well when faced with any number of problems, chemical or otherwise. 
And it did, as best I can tell. 
I'm glad I chose it. 

Another draw toward physics that winter, a warm lantern of familiarity glimpsed through the window of an alien house, was first learning about electronic structure theory.
A (third, physicist) friend told me, dragging me before a whiteboard from my prowls of our Berkeley's Foothill housing corridors, in turn a cool refuge from the broken steam heater in my dorm that turned on November 1 with no appartent off switch, about something called DFT. 
He thought it might appeal to me. 
It did. 
I knew just enough quantum, mostly from my mess of a gen chem class, its...storied... professor (whose main contribution to teaching was puntuating another professor's slides with *The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly*'s theme song to alert us to an impending explosion), and my unphasable, quantum monte carlo-studying GSI, to see a promise in the Kohn-Sham equation, not enough to see the eyes of uncomfortably-approximated many body theory watching me grope in the dark. 
But I learned, more or less correctly, that DFT providing a means to calculate the bands and bonding of material and chemical systems using quantum mechanics, with error coming from correlation and self-interaction in the mean field. 
I knew the word "exchange" entered the mix too. 
Well, quantum and statistical mechanics could be found in the physics department, and so too could the person (Jeff Neaton) who came up first after googling "Berkeley density functional theory."
I didn't immediately jump ship to physics, or attempt to start research in electronic structure. 
But the series of revelations did solidify for me that physics was a possible and powerful pathway to understanding tangible matter, and that conducting research didn't necessarily meaning working in a physical lab. 

As an aside: that November, and a few months that followed, were probably when I was closest to that (third, physicist) friend. We saw each other after (and lived in adjacent rooms for a year), but talked infrequently and with a distance. For the third time in as many paragraphs, friendships and fascinations became part of the past together. 

In 2021 hindsight, maybe it should be clear that DFT would draw me in. 
As a 16 year old in honors chemistry, perhaps the most formative class of my high school days, I remember pouring over tables of formation enthalpies, fascinated by whatever in the electrons' ground state led to those energies. 
I recall digging deeper about why chemical concentrations of products and reactants showed up in the Gibbs free energy, too, and thinking that, in our statistical world, Boltzmann's constant must go deeper than a rescaled parameter for gasses (it turns out it's a unit conversion, but it was a good effort). 
I sparked a fascination for how such chemistry and physics came together in the electronic properties of solids through a final project on halide perovskite photovoltaics. 
And I worked with the teacher who had been the catalyst for it all as a TA, evaluating countless students' understandings. 

So maybe it's unsurprising that I studied physics and kept an eye on the chemical and material. 

But I had other fascinations in high school too. 
Economics, the dismal math at the crime scene of most of humanity's suffering, intrigued me for quite a while, from *Freakonomics* to *The Undercover Economist* to Mr. Lyons' sardonic bemusement at Yugoslavia's "New Dinar." 
So did computer science, in which Josh Paley moved me to see the beauty in abstraction. 
And I liked *Hamlet* for a while too, a fascination ceding in recent years to contemporary, dystopian, and fantastical stories of indecision in the face of a crumbling world. 

I had fascinations beyond academic pursuits. 
It's a bit of a stupid thing to say, even if remembering them tonight challenges my insecurity that from my childhood to now, most of my interests have been fairly underdeveloped. 
I took a number of bike rides into the foothills with friends one spring and summer. 
The friendships outlasted the biking, but not the years since. 
After came a dozen-odd games of tennis, and 40 or so satirical articles related to my high school. 
For seven years, I spent long hours on the wrestling mat; at the time it formed a significant part of my identity, for better or worse. 
I could say it now impacts me strikingly little for something I cared so much about, but I don't think that's true. 
If nothing else, wrestling gave my doughey 6th grade person visible abs and an improved work ethic, both of which I've kept in some form since. 
But it goes deeper. 
When I imagine fighting, for something, through something, I see a wrestler, faking and sweating and snapping and penetrating. 
That visual, and the feeling as well, remains strangely unchanged years after my last stance and motion drill. 
Nor has my middle school fascination with debate and arguing truly gone to waste, even if no more than a few hundred words in a google doc ever came of our plan to write a book (mine along with a good middle school friend I last saw two summers ago). 
Oddly, an initialization from that time still works its way into some of my account logins, and the wisdom to know the aim of an argument would've served me well earlier today.
It's harder to find a consequence of my interest with *Magic the Gathering*, which began in an after school program in elementary school. 
Perhaps the fact that I rarely had anyone to play with weaves into my *Dungeons and Dragons* philosophy that the players have as much a quest as the party, for the best kind of game. 
Even my fascination with creative writing, though my high school wordpress gathers dust, must have worked its way into the mythology and voice with which I write this blog post, after a four year gap. 

This September, I will begin a PhD, and not in volcanology.
My research interests are still mainly in electronic structure theory, methodology for studying quantum mechanics in its natural habitat. 
A wide variety of methods-DMFT, GW, quantum embedding, quantum chemistry's clusters and configurations-excite me greatly, though not (currently) plain old DFT. 
Perhaps I have come to value the interactions, that many-body dance which gives our excitement both wonderous possibility and finite lifetime. 
Perhaps I have not yet come to properly appreciate the mean field, that omnipresent background of everything that makes us what we are. 
Perhaps 5 semesters of quantum have simply changed my tastes. 
I did eventually run a few DFT calculations, as part of a research project on tight binding methods for halide perovskites. 
This project involved (and continues to involve) myriad moving parts, and it has allowed me to develop greatly as a scientist and become a position space stan.
Ironically, the work brought together so many of the fascinations I first cultivated in that chem honors class: why electrons form bonds, the halide perovskite class of materials, thinking a bit more like a scientist. 
I said as much to my chemistry teacher, whose passion and wisdom were so formative in my life, in an email after I submitted the manuscript. 

He didn't write back. 
I suppose I can try again when it is published.
