Today I texted with an old friend who, hearing I was headed to grad school, asked me if I was still interested in volcanoes. 
Not the same old friend I had excitedly texted, in a fit of college-major-reservation-induced soul searching, after learning that "volcanologist" was an extant career, who told me she'd study bulldozers (or was it dump trucks?) if I dropped chem E for volcanoes, but reneged to CS for, she said, the money. 
I haven't spoken to her in a few years. 

I did, however, drop chem E. 
Over a California winter of 4-year plans and introspection, I decided that most of what I liked in chem E was chemistry and feeling like I mattered, and most of what I liked in chemistry was thinking about why things were sticky, and the consequences of jiggling. 
Now I've rebranded them as quantum and stat mech, and graduated with a degree in physics. 
It became the clear choice by that April; I believed its strong mathematical and conceptual foundation, flexibility to explore other topics, and low likelyhood of precipitating death by fume hood would serve me well when faced with any number of problems, chemical or otherwise. 
And it did, as best I can tell. 
I'm glad I chose it. 

Another draw toward physics that winter, a warm lantern of familiarity glimpsed through the window of an alien house, was first learning about electronic structure theory.
A (third, physicist) friend told me, dragging me before a whiteboard from my prowls of our Berkeley's Foothill housing corridors, in turn a cool refuge from the broken steam heater in my dorm that turned on November 1 with no appartent off switch, about something called DFT. 
He thought it might appeal to me. 
It did. 
I knew just enough quantum, mostly from my mess of a gen chem class, its...storied... professor (whose main contribution to teaching was puntuating another professors slides with *The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly*'s theme song to alert us to an impending explosion), and my unphasable, quantum monte carlo-studying GSI, to see a promise in the Kohn-Sham equation, not enough to see the eyes of uncomfortably-approximated many body theory watching me grope in the dark. 
But I learned, more or less correctly, that DFT providing a means to calculate the bands and bonding of material and chemical systems using quantum mechanics, with error coming from correlation and self-interaction in the mean field. 
I knew the word "exchange" entered the mix too. 
Well, quantum and statistical mechanics could be found in the physics department, and so too could the person (Jeff Neaton) who came up first after googling "Berkeley density functional theory."
I didn't immediately jump ship to physics, or attempt to start research in electronic structure. 
But the series of revelations did solidify for me that physics was a possible and powerful pathway to understanding tangible matter, and that conducting research didn't necessarily meaning working in a physical lab. 

As an aside: that November, and a few months that followed, were probably when I was closest to that (third, physicist) friend. We saw each other after (and lived in adjacent rooms for a year), but talked infrequently and with a distance. For the third time in as many paragraphs, friendships and fascinations became part of the past together.
