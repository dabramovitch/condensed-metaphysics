Today I texted with an old friend who, hearing I was headed to grad school, asked me if I was still interested in volcanoes. 
Not the same old friend I had excitedly texted, in a fit of college-major-reservation-induced soul searching, after learning that "volcanologist" was an extant career, who told me she'd study bulldozers (or was it dump trucks?) if I dropped chem E for volcanoes, but reneged to CS for, she said, the money. 
I haven't spoken to her in a few years. 

I did, however, drop chem E. 
Over a California winter of 4-year plans and introspection, I decided that most of what I liked in chem E was chemistry and feeling like I mattered, and most of what I liked in chemistry was thinking about why things were sticky, and the consequences of jiggling. 
Now I've rebranded them as quantum and stat mech, and graduated with a degree in physics. 
It became the clear choice by that April; I believed its strong mathematical and conceptual foundation, flexibility to explore other topics, and low likelyhood of precipitating death by fume hood would serve me well when faced with any number of problems, chemical or otherwise. 
And it did, as best I can tell. 
I'm glad I chose it. 

Another draw toward physics that winter, a warm lantern of familiarity glimpsed through the window of an alien house, was first learning about electronic structure theory.
A (third) friend told me, dragging me before a whiteboard from my prowls of our Berkeley's Foothill housing corridors, in turn a cool refuge from the broken steam heater in my dorm that turned on November 1 with no appartent off switch, about something called DFT.
