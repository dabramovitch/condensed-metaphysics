This was written based on a game of Microscope in a scifi setting. 

That cosmic dusk thou mayst in us behold   
When carbon limbs, or none, or few, do raise   
Pale banners, against failing light to hold,  
Few children left to interstellar haze.  
In us thou see’st the twilight of such a hive  
As mined last phosphate from lunar rest,  
Who scry and scry, quick pens for closure strive,  
Earth’s second self, fair light choked in the west.  
In us thou see’st the metal in such a star  
As forges pigments in hot crucible,  
Which color dreams upon habitable scar,  
And part seas long thought irreducible.  
This we perceive, which makes our love more strong,  
To love life well which we must leave ere long.
