Yesterday, I jammed my thumb doing some movement caught between a sprawl and a downblock. 
I heard some tendons popping, and the joint quickly became tender, and still is today after three or four icings. 
But I think it should heal pretty completely. 
This has, after all, happened to me before. 

Three joints away is an example of the alternative: a slightly knobby joint on my right middle finger which leaves a visual if hardly kinesiological record of when I jammed that finger into the mat during some wrestling practice or other as a high school sophomore. 
That jam too occurred during a downblock. 
It made me tape my hand for several weeks, which in turn led to an opposing coach reaching out his left hand to shake after I pinned his wrestler with a whizzer kick up in what I remember to be a spastic and reactionary minute of wrestling at our annual quad meet. 
That moment, and as I write this the memory of texting a girl about my finger joint that spring, are the things stuck enough in my mind to remind me which of my four years of high school wrestling it happened. 

But whereas that jam seven years ago at least occured during live wrestling, this one is surrounded by weaker stories. 
I started jiu-jitsu in November because I thought it would be an interesting thing to try in grad school, and perhaps also because a mess of grappling in a grad housing common room with a tipsy fight bro I for whatever reason agreed to reawakened some love of grappling within me. 
But so far I'm really loving it. 
Besides finding the groundwork more dynamic and interesting than either turns and escapes in wrestling or any aspect of judo, hitting swing singles and arm drag doubles is fulfilling in a strange, temporally dispersive way. 
It somehow unites in common cause my high school wrestling days with some imagined future in jiu-jitsu, and never my really stopping watching wrestling matches on youtube, and a nice run of the pipe in some fleeting moment on the mat. 
But in any case, between winter break and omicron I have been off the mat for about a month, and have taken to doing some stance and motion to move various things along. 
And so I came to jam my finger in a grad housing apartment living room, working on quick reactionary sprawls with heavy hips. 
And have the first thought "aw fuck, I'm too much a nerd for this sort of injury." 
And then, "would I even go to a doctor if it required it?" 
And then procede to ice it with an ice pack from a prescription drug shipment, which I had thrown in my freezer a few months ago. 


I need only look at the back of my right hand to see that some things last longer than you'd think.
