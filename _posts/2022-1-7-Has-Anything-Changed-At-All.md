Yesterday, I jammed my thumb doing some movement caught between a sprawl and a downblock. 
I heard some tendons popping, and the joint quickly became tender, and still is today after three or four icings. 
But I think it should heal pretty completely. 
This has, after all, happened to me before. 

Three joints away is an example of the alternative: a slightly knobby joint on my right middle finger which leaves a visual if hardly kinesiological record of when I jammed that finger into the mat during some wrestling practice or other as a high school sophomore. 
That jam too occurred during a downblock, but at least I was wrestling live, against a real opponent. 
It made me tape my hand for several weeks, which in turn led to an opposing coach reaching out his left hand to shake after I pinned his wrestler with a whizzer kick up in what I remember to be a spastic and reactionary minute of wrestling at our annual quad meet. 
That moment, and as I write this the memory of texting a girl about my finger joint that spring, are the things stuck enough in my mind to tell me which of my four years of high school wrestling it happened.
