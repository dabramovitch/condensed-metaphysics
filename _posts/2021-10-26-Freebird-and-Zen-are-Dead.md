Things to think about: 
Freebird and Zen story, old lady names (Betsy, Winfred, etc)? and not growing old. (having been asked about veganism earlier)
Spherical cows in a vacuum. 
What is can't be quantified still matters...but they know that, when it's convenient.
Aspects besides animal lives: greenhouse gasses, water, land use, health, pandemics, antimicrobial resistance --> sufficient but not necessary. 
Outside of science...https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/29/science/dairy-farming-cows-milk.html,
*Consider the Lobster* quintessientially DFW footnotes, bittery tolerant homeostatis (I suspect with intelligent people is only bitter one way, unlike the rest of the population). DFW is dead, of suicide. 
, etc
Messenger conversations, picking fights. 
How intelligent people seem to talk about veganism, fights they know they can't win
Education and veganism, intelligence and science in the vegan community. 
Ask for STEM people on r/vegan
Fear of stat mech, and what it means. Critical behavior emerges from large N...but does this mean anything? 
Leftists, science and politics
Replaceability, equilibria, and pain. 
Faith in the world, reducing suffering. 
Physicists approximations and moral conlcusions 
--> nothing in physics says the value of life requires going beyond the first spherical harmonic. is life about moments? 
Life is non-perturbative (exp(-1/lambda^2) (but why taylor expand around 0?) 
By now, Freebird and Zen are probably dead. Or would be if they had existed. Cows are nameless.
