## Motivation 

The Ranger doesn't really seem to come together in *Dungeons and Dragons: 5th Edition*. 
Few experienced players choose them, and many of their abilities are situational or uninspired. 
In many ways, these class features seem to fall into a void between gameplay and roleplay, not particularly useful to either. 
This is unfortunate, because rangers are a classic fantasy archetype (Aragorn, Geralt, Rocket, Halt's Apprentice) which explore the unique theme of boundaries: between civilization and wild, duty and bloodbath, human and other.
Moreover, in D&D they promise strategic and ultimately fun gameplay based not on exhaustive spell lists but using nature and natures in ways others would not. 
In the following, I rewrite the core of the ranger class (leaving the subclasses and spells constant, at least for now), with the aim of making a fun, unique, and balanced class. 

## Overarching themes: Rangers should...
1. ... be skilled at understanding environments and monsters and using this to their advantage. 
2. ... employ strategies reflecting their wisdom, adaptability, and unorthodox skillset and purpose. 
3. ... embrace their position as half casters, interweaving martial, magical, and class abilities in unique ways. 
4. ... routinely take actions in and out of combat that feel unique from those of fighters, druids, and rogues. 
5. ... reflect the above concomitantly in gameplay and roleplay.

### Natural Explorer:
Once per short or long rest, you may make a wisdom check to gain insight about a terrain, enemy, or threat you have encountered. The default DC for such a check is 15, but it can be modified at DM discretion. Also at DM discretion, the check may be use insight, survival, perception, animal handling, or medicine. On a success, you gain your choice of the following bonuses (choose which before rolling). The bonus lasts for 7 days.

* You can move stealthily at a normal pace through the terrain.

* You learn if the enemy is resistant or vulnerable to two damage types of your choice. 


### Ranger Tactics: 
You may choose a number of the following abilities equal to your proficiency bonus.When you finish a long rest, you may swap out one ability for another. 

**Ambusher:** When you roll initiative, any surprised enemies gain a penalty to initiative equal to your wisdom modifier.
