The Ranger doesn't really seem to come together in *Dungeons and Dragons: 5th Edition*. 
Few experienced players choose them, and many of their abilities are situational or uninspired. 
In many ways, these class features seem to fall into a void between gameplay and roleplay, not particularly useful to either. 
This is unfortunate, because rangers are a classic fantasy archetype (Aragorn, Geralt, Halt's Apprentice) which explore the unique theme of boundaries: between civilization and wild, duty and bloodbath, human and other.
Moreover, in D&D they promise strategic and ultimately fun gameplay based not on exhaustive spell lists but using nature and natures in ways others would not. 
In the following, I rewrite the core of the ranger class (leaving the subclasses and spells constant, at least for now), with the aim of making a fun, unique, and balanced class. 

Overarching themes: Rangers should...
1. ... be skilled at understanding environments and monsters and using this to their advantage. 
2. ... employ strategies reflecting their wisdom, adaptability, and unorthodox skillset and purpose. 
3. ... embrace their position as half casters, interweaving martial, magical, and class abilities in unique ways. 
4. ... routinely take actions in and out of combat that feel unique from those of fighters, druids, and rogues. 
5. ... reflect the above concomitantly in gameplay and roleplay.
