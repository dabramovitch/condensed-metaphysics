## Motivation 

The Ranger doesn't really seem to come together in *Dungeons and Dragons: 5th Edition*. 
Few experienced players choose them, and many of their abilities are situational or uninspired. 
In many ways, these class features seem to fall into a void between gameplay and roleplay, not particularly useful to either. 
This is unfortunate, because rangers are a classic fantasy archetype (Aragorn, Geralt, Rocket, Halt's Apprentice) which explore the unique theme of boundaries: between civilization and wild, duty and bloodbath, human and other.
Moreover, in D&D they promise strategic and ultimately fun gameplay based not on exhaustive spell lists but using nature and natures in ways others would not. 
In the following, I rewrite the core of the ranger class (leaving the subclasses and spells constant, at least for now), with the aim of making a fun, unique, and balanced class. 

## Overarching themes: Rangers should...
1. ... be skilled at understanding environments and monsters and using this to their advantage. 
2. ... employ strategies reflecting their wisdom, adaptability, and unorthodox skillset and purpose. 
3. ... embrace their position as half casters, interweaving martial, magical, and class abilities in unique ways. 
4. ... routinely take actions in and out of combat that feel unique from those of fighters, druids, and rogues. 
5. ... reflect the above concomitantly in gameplay and roleplay. 

## Class Features

(who really cares just follow the PHP)

### Natural Explorer (Level 1):
Once per short or long rest, you may make a wisdom check to gain insight about a terrain, enemy, or threat you have encountered. The default DC for such a check is 15, but it can be modified at DM discretion. Also at DM discretion, the check may be use insight, survival, perception, animal handling, or medicine. On a success, you gain your choice of the following bonuses (choose which before rolling). The bonus lasts for 7 days. 
* You gain advantage on wisdom (survival) and intelligence (investigation) checks made to track in the terrain. 
* You gain advantage on wisdom (survival) or intelligence (nature) checks to predict the weather in the terrain. 
* You gain advantage on wisdom (survival) or intelligence (investigation) checks to navigate in the terrain. 
* You gain advantage on wisdom (perception) checks to find enemies hiding using elements of the chosen terrain. 
* You can move stealthily at a normal pace through the terrain. 
* Difficult terrain of the target type does not slow your group's travel.
* Once, you may use your reaction to add 5 to your armor class against a weapon, fighting style, monster, or type of attack you have observed. This lasts until the beginning of your next turn.
* You gain advantage on wisdom (survival) and intelligence (investigation) checks made to track the enemy. 
* You learn if the enemy is resistant or vulnerable to two damage types of your choice. 
* You learn if the enemy's strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom, charisma, armor class, or hit points is much lower, somewhat lower, the same, somewhat higher, or much higher than yours. 
* You become atuned to a specific sound, smell, or other sensation associated with the target terrain or enemy and have advantage on wisdom (perception) checks involving the sensation.
* You gain advantage on wisdom (medicine) saves to related to injuries or conditions inflicted by the target monster or environment. 

### Hunter's Mark (Level 1): 
You may use a bonus action to apply a Hunter's mark to an enemy or 10 ft radius area around a fixed point. You may do this a number of times equal to you proficiency bonus per long rest. 
You must concentrate on hunter's mark like a spell, and must make checks to maintain concentration. However, you may concentrate on hunter's mark and a spell at the same time. 
Additionally, the damage die for hunter's mark is a d4. It increases to a d6 at level 5, a d8 at level 10, and a d10 at level 15. 
The hunter's mark is otherwise the same as the spell, and functionally replaces it. 

### Fighting Style and Spellcasting (Level 2): 
For fighting styles, see PHP, this is unchanged. 
For spellcasting, see PHP. The only change is that instead of knowing a fixed number of spells, you may prepare a number of spells equal to half your ranger level + wisdom modifier on a long rest. 

### Ranger Archetype (Level 3): 
See player's handbook and expansions. 

### Ranger Tactics (Level 6): 
You may choose a number of the following abilities equal to your proficiency bonus. When you finish a long rest, you may swap out one ability for another. 

**Ambusher:** When you roll initiative, any surprised enemies gain a penalty to initiative equal to your wisdom modifier.   
**Trapper:** Choose one ally. The next time you or the ally force enemies to make a dexterity or stength saving throw, they gain a penalty equal to your wisdom modifier. This resets on a short rest.   
**Evader:** When you take the dodge action in combat, you may use your bonus action to make a single attack.   
**Hexer:** When you cast a spell which augments a weapon attack and applies only when the attack hits, you do not expend the spell slot if the attack misses.   
**Precise Hunter:** Against enemies affected by your hunter's mark, you deal a critical hit on a 19 or 20.   
**Anti-caster:** Enemies affected by your hunter's mark have disadvantage on checks to maintain concentration against damage you deal.   
**Mobile Fighter:** When you take the disengage action, your movement speed increases by 50% until the end of your turn.   
**Endurer:** You have advantage against checks made to prevent levels of exhaustion.   
**Improviser:** You have proficiency with improvised weapons.   
**Sage:** On topics related to your experiences and adventures, you may use wisdom in place of charisma as the modifier for persuasion and intimidation checks.
