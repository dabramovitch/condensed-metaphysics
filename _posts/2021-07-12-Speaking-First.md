Speaking First 

Kenjen looked between them, willing his sleeping mind to feel out avenues, dilate in interstitials. *Malory*, a self-assured thoroughfare for the quiet words exchanged three tables down, *Phit*, whose eyes had lowered to his text from peering up at the sound of his name. And *her, Lyra*, sitting across from him, eyes glinting, entertained, awaiting Kenjen’s response. The three names had a nice ring to them, a concreteness his brain wanted to latch onto, but now he knew another kind of thinking would be required too. Required, at least, for the simple, clever solution, the kind where understanding came slowly and then all at once, relaxing his parsed lips and narrowed eyes, the kind of thinking that had jumped Kenjen levels in this year’s AIME compared to last’s.  

Mallory leaned over the back of a chair in a dozen paces in front of him, unmoved from when Lyra poised the question. He gripped a piece of chalk in the hand resting on the table, long forgotten in favor of conversation. Phit continued to sit three empty chairs to Kenjen’s right, and Lyra pushed her folded arms across the table not three feet in front of him. If the triangle they constituted was spatial, which Kenjen knew deep down it wasn’t, it was badly scalene. He drew his gaze up from Lyra’s hands and over her shoulder; there were two girls he didn’t know at the table behind her who would probably qualify as enclosed within the three edges, and they’d been in the Academic Center for some time. But no, previous rounds had made clear the answer was more subtle.  

He unclenched his teeth and tried to regroup his thinking. These questions always possessed a sort of heart, a *why* the question *was* a question, and asked of him. The last part confused him. Nearly forty-five minutes ago, Lyra had sat down across from him, pulled out her laptop, smiled, and asked what he was working on. They shared chemistry and CS sections; she’d spoken with him a few times before, and he thought she knew that they both liked art, and escapism, of different sorts. Then Kenjen had thought about asking her a question, but he didn’t know which. A few minutes had passed, and then Lyra asked him if he wanted a puzzle; he thought maybe because she knew he liked math challenges. That surprised him, but he said yes, wondering if it was the case that the key to the puzzle was figuring out the sort of “boundaries to the solution.” He wasn’t sure if he liked those or not. Then she had said she wasn’t sure if it was really a puzzle, or “maybe one of those ‘put the pieces together’ games.” That had made him a bit nervous.  

What had followed was forty minutes of confusion about what it meant for people to create and occupy triangles. Since last winter, Kenjen had often told himself that being confused was how you leaned, but he’d meant it about math. Math routinely confused him—14 problems and 125 minutes into the AIME, watching *The Essence of Linear Algebra*, curl—but it made sense too. Most things, Kenjen, reflected, seemed to do neither. American history, social circles, his family’s coldness, he knew the surface level facts but could find no handholds for understanding. They made no place for him.  

The first triplet Lyra had named was Grace, her study partner and apparent coconspirator, who’d since departed, a boy in a cardinal hoody who she had known, though Kenjen hadn’t, and Mr. O'Casey, their chemistry teacher who had walked by outside. Lyra really enjoyed him and his class, he knew. Kenjen tried to too, but he found it difficult after a few incidents where O'Casey had called on him, a habit with quieter students, and then after a few moments hintingly rephrased his question, not unkindly, but interrupting Kenjen’s process of fitting words to the answer all the same. He’d had no real idea who was in that triangle, so he’d first thought about it geometrically: tilting his head up, envisioning spheres of variable radius and confirming to himself that three points were equidistant from another in their plane, guessing a few people near where he judged such a point should lie. Those were wrong, as he suspected since it would make a weak riddle, and so were a few other guesses of people enclosed by the relevant triangle, unsurprisingly. In the end, Lyra told him the answer was Kella, who’d ran out of the study center after a rushed print-and-stapling with an outgoing hello to Lyra and Grace shortly after the Lyra had posed the question.  

Next Kenjen had tried linguistic patterns, perhaps because Lyra seemed to know each human vertex by name. A triangle of Brent, Arnel, and Elly left him guessing the girl in overalls currently wiping the floor with two classmates in a game of Bananagrams whose name he recalled was Elizabeth (it had really been the loudspeaker that cut off the end of Lyra’s question). That lead him to consider anagrams, and he contorted his brain for several minutes thinking of them, before Lyra asked him what plane of existence he’d wandered off to. She’d seemed bemused and a bit impressed when he told her, and she guiltily told him it didn’t have to do with anagrams, or in fact letters at all. When thirty minutes and a dozen triangles had passed, he’d confessed to her that if it had to do with the *who* the people were, a common trait or someone they all knew, he was likely hopeless. It felt strange to admit to, the truth that most of the social understandings in their school eluded him. And even stranger was whatever about Lyra had drawn it out of him, let him step around his usual anxiety about it like an anglerfish in resin, a monstrosity with lure and teeth but no bite.  

But Lyra had just laughed pleasantly and told him no, it the pattern wasn’t based in some social webbing. You’re overthinking it, he heard her say, but he didn’t think she meant it badly. One more, then I’ll tell you, she’d told him this round. Something inside him snagged at that, wanted to tell her he would keep guessing, that that was how you learned. But he said alright. Something else in him knew it was okay to ask for help, even for the first time. She’d listed Malory then, turning around in her chair so her shirt stretched across her shoulder blades like a desmos surface full of life, and then Phit, onyx hair curtaining her ear again as she faced their table.  

She paused then, and the smiled. “And me,” she finished. “Who’s in the triangle?” 

“You?” Something personal in it had cut through his armor.  

She’d nodded then, a lovely warmth dancing across her face, and he knew she believed in him this time. He’d looked away in that moment, searching vertex to vertex, reviewing mental proofs and constructions, parsing letters, wondering what it meant for him that she knew so many names he did not. He’d tried to intuit, to feel some pattern in the three names, in the spaces around them and the people within, casting his gaze around the room intensely, to little end.  

All that had brought him here, unclenching his teeth, softening his gaze, scrambling for a handhold. When she’d said the game was to put the pieces together, he should have known it would go like this, as it did with anything he faced without a clear solution space. He’d been right to be nervous then. . . though maybe it wasn’t quite the statement but the way she smiled as she said it.  

She was smiling that way now. Quickly, he closed his mouth and dropped his eyes. He exhaled. His mind couldn’t contain a triangle in that moment, just the short space between them, tethering him back into the immediate. And then he knew.  

Like Kella and the loudspeaker, he’d spoken first.  

“I am.” He met Lyra’s eyes again. “Because of ‘You.’”
