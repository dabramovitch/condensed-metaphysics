Today, in a class on the statistical physics of intereacting systems and fields, in the 2nd week of my graduate education, the professor said he had a helpful mnemonic to remember the form of the entropic contribution to the Helmholtz free energy of a variational trial distribution.
I believe, though it may not be true, that the first mnemonic I learned was during a piano lesson. 
It stated that *every good boy does fine*. 
But do not misunderstand: I know nothing about piano. 
I merely took it for a few months when I was about five, if I remember correctly, because one of my friends told me "if you do piano that means you're smart." 

Well now we, like the majority of my waking hours, must return to physics. 
As I said, I am just beginning my PhD.
And unlike piano, I do not *think* I am doing it because it fulfills some social expectation about what it means to be smart. 
In fact, am a bit countercultural toward some of the mainstream physics ideas about what it means for science to be pure, beautiful, or worthy. 
But I can't be certain toward my inner motivations. 
Identities are scrapped together judiciously and dynamically, veritable ships of Theseus, but their cohesion may be like the ship as well, thoroughly built and bulwarked around the constraints of the unbreathable depths they're intended to exlude. 
Or not. 
Passion and insecurity invariably layer like cloud and sky on the horizon at sunset: sometimes distinguishable, sometimes not, the totality, uncaring, merely beautiful for the light. 
Say only that I am more than ever appreciating the intricate interactions, and that I am taking statistical mechanics, and that those are largely but not entirely unrelated. 

In this stat mech lecture, the helpful mnemonic was that a certain contribution was equivalent to the Shannon entropy. 
A worthy, though not truly surprising, observation. 
But in my mind a strange thing to call a mnemonic, a device for remembering. 

I have learned a number of things, some of which I remember, and if I think a bit harder I can remember some of the mnemonics too. 
Not long after *every good boy does fine* were *eyes on the side (in front), likes to hide (hunt)* (about animals) and *a sin is never right* (about Hebrew letters). 
Some time later came the quadratic formula sung to "pop goes the weasel",  shoulder-knee alignment (in wrestling), and *PCP, narcotics, and marijuana are excellent choices* (for the phylla in animalia).

I started taking physics at 17 or 18 and never really stopped. 
Though as a PhD student, I must have a deal more classes behind me than ahead. 
Did I learn any mnemonics in physics? 
For some reason it's difficult to recall?
When I could not remember the Euler-Lagrange equations, I would check the dimensions, or the case yielding *F = ma*. 
It worked, generates equations of motion, but there was no music in it. 
Are there any fun and informative permutations of letters? 
I suppose the **GW** approximations features a self-energy of *i***GW**. 
It's a good name, I suppose, for the interaction of propagating in the face of a dynamically screened potential. 
Scienctific literature features a host of abbreviations, a few perhaps amusing. 
Proper time is one's one, I seem to recall, like *property*, or *propria*. 
Does etymology qualify as a mnemonic? 
Or a humorous name, like *dumb holes* (relatable tbh) or *Gibbs free energy* (I not stop for such a sign beside the road). 
A bit of fun, or a bit of connection, does aid the memory, and it seems that when it comes to mnemonics, physics needs all the help it can get. 

But I have learned in physics, there is no doubt of that. 
And conciously or not, mnemoniced or not, I have constructed some deep and intuitive conceputal understanding, creating storied, personal mythologies for abstract fundamentals in physics. 
If I require an uninspired twenty seconds to verify the signs of the Euler-Lagrange equation, it does not stop me from seeking meaning in action and a path integrals myriad journeys. 
I remember at one point thinking that *The Road Less Travelled* might well have been about the Aharonov-Bohm effect, in both, two paths may be indistinguishable, but indecision over which to follow creates measureable interferrence well beyond. 
**GW** is a good but uncreative name, but it *is* good to have a framework to understand how the interactions we do see are nudged by so many we don't. 
And there is nothing uncreative about the imaginativeness unleashed by thinking in the framework of propagation and dynamical interaction: **GW** was my first foray into many body theory. 
Even proper time means something to me, I'm sure, or it may one day. 
It's true that special relativity has never been a strength of mine. 
(Today I spent fifteen minutes unable to remember the Lorentz transformation for a boost in 1+1 dimensions. when I did, it was through determinants and google searches, not rhymes or abreviation). 
I've taken a semester of it, so perhaps my struggles are because of the geometry, perhaps because it has never felt mine. 
But as I am taking relativistic QFT, I will need it. 
Perhaps proper time can enable that connection: if I don't count the ticks of my own watch, then I can march to the beat of my own drum.
It is strange tracing these conceptual threads in hindsight, understanding comes from truly unexpected places. 
I guess I learned that in stat mech: Shannon entropy states that the unpredictable tells us more*. 

And I have learned while being a physicist, which reaches far beyond the physical. 
I will leave the details to other writing, but the core of it is growing up, and being a good person besides a good scientist. 
The two are not synonymous, that is sadly and obviously true, illustrated by the world among other things, but I think there is reason for optimism too. 
People are people, some do good and others bad, but there are things science can help us understand and help us remember. 

Grad school is about intelligence and knowledge, but I suspect a deeper sort of wisdom will be necessary too, if I am to get by. 
Moreover, it is half a decade of life. 
Both understanding physics and everything else will be important; moreover, I'm not sure they are completely distinguishable. 

All of this means many things; one is that now, at this beginning, there is much to remember. 
I do not know that mnemonics are the best way to , certainly, despite the scarcity in physics, I have heard too many to keep in my head. 
But maybe merely the first and the last are a worthy approximation: that *every good boy does fine*, and that the unpredictable often tells us the most. 


\*There is kind of a caveat here that more information does not necessary equate to more knowledge. But with some conceptual guidance the idea is there.
