Today, in a class on the statistical physics of intereacting systems and fields, in the 2nd week of my graduate education, the professor said he had a helpful mnemonic to remember the form of the entropic contribution to the Helmholtz free energy of a variational trial distribution.
I believe, though it may not be true, that the first mnemonic I learned was during a piano lesson. 
It stated that *every good boy does fine*. 
But do not misunderstand: I know nothing about piano. 
I merely took it for a few months when I was about five, if I remember correctly, because one of my friends told me "if you do piano that means you're smart." 

Well now we, like the majority of my waking hours, must return to physics. 
As I said, I am just beginning my PhD.
And unlike piano, I do not *think* I am doing it because it fulfills some social expectation about what it means to be smart. 
In fact, am a bit countercultural toward some of the mainstream physics ideas about what it means for science to be pure, beautiful, or worthy. 
But I can't be certain toward my inner motivations. 
Identities are scrapped together judiciously and dynamically, veritable ships of Theseus, but their cohesion may be like the ship as well, thoroughly built and bulwarked around the constraints of the unbreathable depths they're intended to exlude. 
Or not. 
Passions and insecurity invariably layer like cloud and sky on the horizon at sunset: sometimes distinguishable, sometimes not, the totality, uncaring, merely beautiful for the light. 
Say only that I am more than ever appreciating the intricate interactions, and that I am taking statistical mechanics, and that those are largely but not entirely unrelated. 

In this stat mech lecture, the helpful mnemonic was that a certain contribution was equivalent to the Shannon entropy. 
A worthy, though not truly surprising, observation. 
But in my mind a strange thing to call a mnemonic, a device for remembering. 

I have learned a number of things, some of which I remember, and if I think a bit harder I can remember some of the mnemonics too. 
Not long after *every good boy does fine* were *eyes on the side (in front), likes to hide (hunt)* (about animals) and *a sin is never right* (about Hebrew letters). 
Some time later came the quadratic formula sung to "pop goes the weasel",  shoulder-knee alignment (in wrestling), and *PCP, narcotics, and marijuana are excellent choices* (for the phylla in animalia).
