Today, in a class on the statistical physics of intereacting systems and fields, in the 2nd week of my graduate education, the professor said he had a helpful mnemonic to remember the form of the entropic contribution to the Helmholtz free energy of a variational trial distribution.
I believe, though it may not be true, that the first mnemonic I learned was during a piano lesson. 
It stated that *every good boy does fine*. 
But do not misunderstand: I know nothing about piano. 
I merely took it for a few months when I was about five, if I remember correctly, because one of my friends told me "if you do piano that means you're smart." 

Well now we, like the majority of my waking hours, must return to physics. 
As I said, I am just beginning my PhD.
And unlike piano, I do not *think* I am doing it because it fulfills some social expectation about what it means to be smart. 
In fact, am a bit countercultural toward some of the mainstream physics ideas about what it means for science to be pure, beautiful, or worthy. 
But I can't be certain toward my inner motivations.
